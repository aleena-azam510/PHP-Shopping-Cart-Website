# How Our Shopping Cart Works

This website makes online shopping super easy! It has four main pages that all work together:

## 1. Login/Signup Page

This is where you start. You either **create a new account** or **log in** if you've been here before. We remember who you are while you shop.

## 2. Items Page (Our Shop)

Here, you'll see **15 different products** with pictures, names, and prices. If you like something, just click **"Add to Cart"**.

## 3. Cart Page (Your Shopping Bag)

This page shows **everything you've put in your cart**. You'll see the items, their prices, and how many you want. You can easily **change the number of items** or **remove things** you don't want anymore.

## 4. Checkout Page (Finish Your Order)

When you're ready to buy, this page gives you a **summary of your cart** and the **total price**. Once you confirm, your purchase is complete, and your cart gets cleared for next time!


**Important:** I  make sure you're logged in before you can shop or see your cart. Here it will  also keep track of your cart and details as you move between pages so your shopping experience is smooth and hassle-free.
